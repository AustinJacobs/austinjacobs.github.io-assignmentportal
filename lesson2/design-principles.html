            <div class="content-body">
                <p class="website">Apple</p>

                <p class="description">Apple uses a lot of white space on all of their webpages. In the photo above, you can see that the designers decided to go with a centered format for their text. This creates white space around all of the text which allows the eye to relax when not looking directly at the text. This also creates a spotlight effect and really makes the view focus in on what is trapped in the white space. 

                  <br/><br/>There is also a very clean design around the app logos that Apple has displayed in this photo. The spacing is equal between all of the app icons, and they are aligned perfectly. This helps create a very clean a simple layout that is visually appealing to the eye.

                <p class="description">The contrast in the photo above is spectacular. The large font in a bright yellow against the bright red background is the first and most recognizable example of contrast. They also have the toy figurines in a lighter color against the bright red background which makes them very visible.<br/><br/> Even the logo in the top left corner and the hamburger icon really contrast against the bright red background. It is easy to clearly see everything on the page, adn the contrast created makes looking at the page very enjoyable. </p>

                <p class="description">The designers at Huffington Post have done a great job of repeating one very important thing; font style. Anything that is a news article is in the same black and bolded font. This makes navigating the page extremely easy once the user understands what to look for. The large headline on the featured article has the same font as the smaller articles, and this makes the site look very professional. <br/><br/> It would be very easy to try out different fonts for the different levels of importance, but because the designers chose not to do this, their site is easy to navigate and look at. There aren't lots of different colors to confuse the viewer or distract their eye.</p>
